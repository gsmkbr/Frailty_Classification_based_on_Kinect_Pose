# Frailty Classification based on Microsoft Kinect Pose Data
This project deals with calssification of frailty level of humans based on Kinect time series obtained during various physical exercises. 

# Instruction for using the codes
The main file for execution of program is "main.py" existed in the "Code" folder. All other files are moduels and class files defined for different purposes. The main Dataset for frailty classification can not be published publically, due to copyright. However, a part of the dataset utilized for validation of the code, which is based on a publicallly available dataset, is located in the "Data.rar" archive. This dataset deals with calssification of humans gender based on their gait Kinect data. The complete dataset of this validation test case can be freely found in the web.
